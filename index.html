<blockquote cite="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1030/1954">Online learning has a number of potential benefits, 
not least of which is the ability to overcome the temporal and spatial restrictions of traditional educational settings (Bates, 2005). 
Freedom from constraint may also be seen as a defining feature of distance learning, for example freedom of content, space, medium, 
access (Paulsen, 1993), and relationship development (Anderson, 2006). Notwithstanding the advantages that online learning offers, a 
variety of factors have been identified as crucial to the success of online courses (McIsaac & Gunawardena, 1996). Motivation is one 
such factor (Bekele, 2010). Just as motivation is a key factor in learning and achievement in face-to-face educational contexts (Brophy, 2010), 
so it is in online learning environments (Jones & Issroff, 2007).</blockquote></p></FONT>

<p><i><b>1. Usefulness</i></b> - Students need to see that the course is useful and relevant to them within the course and beyond. 
In some cases it will be obvious that the skills that students will acquire in a course will directly contribute to 
their success in a chosen career field.</p>

<p><i><b>2. Success</i></b> - Students need to feel that they can succeed in the course if they make a reasonable effort. 
The instructor can help students succeed by setting expectations, providing feedback, and facilitating the course 
so that students have access to additional resources if needed.</p>

<p><i><b>3. Interest</i></b> - These are just little side readings that don’t take a lot of time and that might help students see 
how the [concept of interest] might apply to the real world. Motivation can influence what we learn, how we learn, and when we choose to learn.</p>

<p><i><b>4. Caring</i></b> - Students need to feel that the instructor (and other students) care that they learn. The student should ideally receive feedback on at 
least one individual assignment. This provides the instructor with the opportunity to make a connection with the student, thus encourage and motivate 
a student just at the point when the student is moving towards becoming an independent learner.</p>

<p><i><b>5. Empowerment</i></b> - Students feel empowered when they feel that they have some control over some aspects of their learning. 
This can involve giving students choices.</p>
